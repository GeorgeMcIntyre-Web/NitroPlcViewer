# 🔧 Task-Program Relationship Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The Studio 5000 tree structure was incorrectly showing Tasks and Programs as separate top-level sections, when Programs should be children of Tasks.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed NitroPlcViewer.html
**Removed incorrect separate Programs section** (lines 1136-1190):
- Deleted the standalone "Programs" section that was showing at the controller level
- This was the main issue causing the incorrect structure

**Updated Tasks section** to show Programs inside Tasks:
- Modified the Tasks rendering to include Programs as children of each Task
- Added proper nesting: Task → Programs → Individual Programs → Routines
- Added metadata showing task type, priority, and program counts

### 2. Verified Correct Implementation
**Parser** (`js/parser.js`): ✅ Already correct
- Uses `task.querySelectorAll('Programs > Program')` to parse programs within tasks
- Correctly extracts program data, routines, tags, and parameters

**Modular renderer** (`js/main.js`): ✅ Already correct  
- `renderTasks()` function properly shows Programs inside Tasks
- Includes all program details: tags, routines, parameters

**RockwellViewer.html**: ✅ Already correct
- Already had the proper Task → Programs structure

## Result: Correct Studio 5000 Structure

**BEFORE (Broken)**:
```
📁 Controller
├── ⚙️ Tasks (2 tasks)
│   ├── 🔄 MainTask (empty - no children)
│   └── ⏰ SafetyTask (empty - no children)
└── 📋 Programs (38 programs) ← WRONG - separate section
```

**AFTER (Fixed)**:
```
📁 Controller
├── ⚙️ Tasks (2 tasks)
│   ├── 🔄 MainTask (CONTINUOUS)
│   │   └── 📋 Programs (25 programs)
│   │       ├── 📄 C100_CommonSafety_Edit
│   │       └── 📄 C100_HMI_Comm
│   └── ⏰ SafetyTask (PERIODIC)
│       └── 📋 Programs (13 programs)
│           ├── 📄 HMI1_ScreenDriver
│           └── 📄 MainProgram
```

## Files Modified
1. `NitroPlcViewer.html` - Removed separate Programs section, updated Tasks to include Programs
2. All other files already had correct implementation

## Testing
- Server can be started with `python server.py`
- Load an L5X file to verify the correct tree structure
- Expand Tasks to see Programs as children
- No separate Programs section should appear at controller level

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
The Studio 5000 tree structure now correctly shows Programs as children of Tasks, matching the Logix Designer interface.
